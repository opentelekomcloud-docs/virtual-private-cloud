What Is Virtual Private Cloud?
==============================

Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) enables you to provision logically isolated virtual networks for Elastic Cloud Servers (ECSs), improving cloud resource security and simplifying network deployment. You can configure and manage the virtual networks as required.

Within your own VPC, you can create security groups and VPNs, configure IP address ranges, specify bandwidth sizes, manage the networks in the VPC, and make changes to these networks as needed, quickly and securely. You can also customize the ECS access rules within a security group and between security groups to enhance ECS security.
