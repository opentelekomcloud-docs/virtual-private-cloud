Deleting a Security Group
=========================

Scenarios
---------

This section describes how to delete security groups.

Notes and Constraints
---------------------

-  The default security group is named **default** and cannot be deleted.

-  A security group cannot be deleted if it is being used by instances, such as cloud servers, containers, and databases.

   If you need to delete such a security group, delete the instances or change the security group used by the instance first.

-  A security group cannot be deleted if it is used as the source or destination of a rule in another security group.

   :ref:`Delete <vpc_securitygroup_0006>` or :ref:`modify <vpc_securitygroup_0005>` the rule and delete the security group again.

   For example, if the source of a rule in security group **sg-B** is set to **sg-A**, you need to delete or modify the rule in **sg-B** before deleting **sg-A**.
