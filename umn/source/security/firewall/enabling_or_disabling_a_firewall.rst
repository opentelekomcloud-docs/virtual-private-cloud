Enabling or Disabling a Firewall
================================

Scenarios
---------

After a firewall is created, you may need to enable it based on network security requirements. You can also disable an enabled firewall if need. Before enabling a firewall, ensure that subnets have been associated with the firewall and that inbound and outbound rules have been added to the firewall.

When a firewall is disabled, custom rules will become invalid while default rules still take effect. Disabling a firewall may interrupt network traffic. For information about the default firewall rules, see :ref:`Default Firewall Rules <acl_0001__section99541345213>`.
