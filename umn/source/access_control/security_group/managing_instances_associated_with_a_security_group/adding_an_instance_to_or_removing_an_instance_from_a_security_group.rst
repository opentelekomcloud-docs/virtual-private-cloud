Adding an Instance to or Removing an Instance from a Security Group
===================================================================

Scenarios
---------

When you create an instance, the system automatically adds the instance to a security group for protection.

-  If one security group cannot meet your requirements, you can add an instance to multiple security groups.
-  An instance must be added to at least one security group. If you want to change the security group for an instance, you can add the instance to a new security group and then remove the instance from the original security group.
