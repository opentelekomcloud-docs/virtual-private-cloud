VPC and Other Services
======================

-  ECS

   The VPC service provides an isolated virtual network for ECSs. You can configure and manage the network as required. There are multiple connectivity options for ECSs to access the Internet. You can also define rules for communication between ECSs in the same security group or in different security groups.

-  ELB

   ELB uses the EIPs and bandwidths associated with the VPC service.

-  Cloud Eye

   You can use Cloud Eye to monitor the status of your VPCs without adding plug-ins.
