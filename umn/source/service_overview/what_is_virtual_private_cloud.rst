What Is Virtual Private Cloud?
==============================

Overview
--------

The Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) service enables you to provision logically isolated virtual networks for Elastic Cloud Servers (ECSs), improving cloud resource security and simplifying network deployment. You can configure and manage the virtual networks as required.

Within your own VPC, you can create security groups and VPNs, configure IP address ranges, specify bandwidth sizes, manage the networks in the VPC, and make changes to these networks as needed, quickly and securely. You can also define rules to control communications between ECSs in the same security group or in different security groups.

Accessing the VPC Service
-------------------------

You can access the VPC service through the management console or using HTTPS-based APIs.

-  Management console

   You can use the console to directly perform operations on VPC resources. To access the VPC service, log in to the management console and select **Virtual Private Cloud** from the console homepage.

-  API

   If you need to integrate a VPC into a third-party system for secondary development, you can use APIs to access the VPC service. For details, see the `Virtual Private Cloud API Reference <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/virtual-private-cloud/api-ref/api_usage_guidelines.html>`__.
