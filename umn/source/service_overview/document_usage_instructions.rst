Document Usage Instructions
===========================

Instructions for using this document are as follows:

-  To facilitate your operations, the management console may provide more than one way for you to perform a task or an operation. This document describes only the main way.

-  You can click |image1| next to some parameter values to quickly edit the values. This document does not describe this function.

-  Click |image2| in the lower right corner of the console to switch between the new and the old consoles. The old edition does not have the function of associating a subnet with a route table.

   This document provides two sets of operation guides. (The "Getting Started" chapter uses the new console edition as an example.)

   -  If you use the new console edition, see :ref:`Operation Guide (New Console Edition) <vpc_newui_0000>`.
   -  If you use the old console edition, see :ref:`Operation Guide (Old Console Edition) <vpc_oldui_0000>`.
