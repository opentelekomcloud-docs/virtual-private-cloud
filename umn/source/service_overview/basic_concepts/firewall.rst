Firewall
========

A firewall is an optional layer of security for your subnets. After you associate one or more subnets with a firewall, you can control traffic in and out of the subnets.

   **Figure 1** Security groups and firewalls

Similar to security groups, firewalls control access to subnets and add an additional layer of defense to your subnets. Security groups only have the "allow" rules, but firewalls have both "allow" and "deny" rules. You can use firewalls together with security groups to implement comprehensive and fine-grained access control.
