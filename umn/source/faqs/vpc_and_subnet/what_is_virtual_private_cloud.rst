What Is Virtual Private Cloud?
==============================

The Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) service enables you to provision logically isolated, configurable, and manageable virtual networks for Elastic Cloud Servers (ECSs), improving cloud resource security and simplifying network deployment.

Within your own VPC, you can create security groups and VPNs, configure IP address ranges, specify bandwidth sizes, manage the networks in the VPC, and make changes to these networks as needed, quickly and securely. You can also define rules for communication between ECSs in the same security group or in different security groups.
