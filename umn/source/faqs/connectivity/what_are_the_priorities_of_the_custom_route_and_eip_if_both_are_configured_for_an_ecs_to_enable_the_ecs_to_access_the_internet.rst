What Are the Priorities of the Custom Route and EIP If Both Are Configured for an ECS to Enable the ECS to Access the Internet?
===============================================================================================================================

The priority of an EIP is higher than that of a custom route in a VPC route table. For example:

The VPC route table of an ECS has a custom route with 0.0.0.0/0 as the destination and NAT gateway as the next hop.

If an ECS in the VPC has an EIP bound, the VPC route table will have a policy-based route with 0.0.0.0/0 as the destination, which has a higher priority than its custom route. In this case, traffic is forwarded to the EIP and cannot reach the NAT gateway.
