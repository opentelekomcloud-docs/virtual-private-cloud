How Many VPC Peering Connections Can I Create?
==============================================

Each account can have a maximum of 50 VPC peering connections in each region by default.

-  VPC peering connections between VPCs in one account: Each account can create a maximum of 50 VPC peering connections in one region.

-  VPC peering connections between VPCs of different accounts: Accepted VPC peering connections use the quotas of both accounts. To-be-accepted VPC peering connections only use the quotas of accounts that request the connections.

   An account can create VPC peering connections with different accounts if the account has enough quota.
