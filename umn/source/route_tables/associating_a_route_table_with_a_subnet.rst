Associating a Route Table with a Subnet
=======================================

Scenarios
---------

After a subnet is created, the system associates the subnet with the default route table of its VPC. If you want to use specific routes for a subnet, you can associate the subnet with a custom route table.

The custom route table associated with a subnet affects only the outbound traffic. The default route table determines the inbound traffic.

.. important::

   After a route table is associated with a subnet, the routes in the route table control the routing for the subnet and apply to all cloud resources in the subnet.

Notes and Constraints
---------------------

-  A subnet must have a route table associated and can only be associated with one route table.
-  A route table can be associated with multiple subnets.
