VPC Flow Log Overview
=====================

What Is a VPC Flow Log?
-----------------------

A VPC flow log records information about the traffic going to and from a VPC. VPC flow logs help you monitor network traffic, analyze network attacks, and determine whether security group and firewall rules require modification.

VPC flow logs must be used together with the Log Tank Service (LTS). Before you create a VPC flow log, you need to create a log group and a log stream in LTS. :ref:`Figure 1 <flowlog_0002__fig20742104751616>` shows the process for configuring VPC flow logs.
