Enabling or Disabling VPC Flow Log
==================================

Scenarios
---------

After a VPC flow log is created, the VPC flow log is automatically enabled. If you do not need to record flow log data, you can disable the corresponding VPC flow log. A disabled VPC flow log can be enabled again.

Notes and Constraints
---------------------

-  After a VPC flow log is enabled, the system starts to collect flow logs in the next log collection period.
-  After a VPC flow log is disabled, the system stops collecting flow logs in the next log collection period. Generated flow logs will still be reported.
