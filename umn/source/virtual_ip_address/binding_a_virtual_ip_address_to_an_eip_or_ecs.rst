Binding a Virtual IP Address to an EIP or ECS
=============================================

Scenarios
---------

You can bind a virtual IP address to an EIP so that you can access the ECSs bound with the same virtual IP address from the Internet. These ECSs can work in the active/standby mode to improve fault tolerance.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to the management console.
#. Click |image1| in the upper left corner and select the desired region and project.
#. Click |image2| in the upper left corner and choose **Network** > **Virtual Private Cloud**.
#. In the navigation pane on the left, choose **Virtual Private Cloud** > **Subnets**.
#. In the subnet list, click the name of the subnet that the virtual IP address belongs to.
#. Click the **IP Addresses** tab.

   -  To bind a virtual IP address to an EIP, locate the row that contains the virtual IP address and click **Bind to EIP** in the **Operation** column.
   -  To bind a virtual IP address to an ECS, locate the row that contains the virtual IP address and click **Bind to Server** in the **Operation** column.

#. Select the desired EIP, or ECS and its NIC.

   .. note::

      -  If the ECS has multiple NICs, bind the virtual IP address to the primary NIC.
      -  Multiple virtual IP addresses can be bound to an ECS NIC.

#. Click **OK**.

9. Manually configure the virtual IP address bound to an ECS.

   After a virtual IP address is bound to an ECS NIC, you need to manually configure the virtual IP address on the ECS.

   **Linux OS** (CentOS 7.2 64bit is used as an example.)

   a. .. _en-us_topic_0067802474__li528316578916:

      Run the following command to obtain the NIC to which the virtual IP address is to be bound and the connection of the NIC:

      **nmcli connection**

      Information similar to the following is displayed:

      |image3|

      The command output in this example is described as follows:

      -  **eth0** in the **DEVICE** column indicates the NIC to which the virtual IP address is to be bound.
      -  **Wired connection 1** in the **NAME** column indicates the connection of the NIC.

   b. Run the following command to add the virtual IP address for the target connection:

      **nmcli connection modify "**\ *CONNECTION*\ **" ipv4.addresses** *VIP*

      Configure the parameters as follows:

      -  CONNECTION: connection of the NIC obtained in :ref:`9.a <en-us_topic_0067802474__li528316578916>`.
      -  VIP: virtual IP address to be added.

         -  If you add multiple virtual IP addresses at a time, separate them with commas (,).
         -  If a virtual IP address already exists and you need to add a new one, the command must contain both the new and original virtual IP addresses.

      Example commands:

      -  Adding a single virtual IP address: **nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 1" ipv4.addresses** **172.16.0.125**
      -  Adding multiple virtual IP addresses: **nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 1" ipv4.addresses** **172.16.0.125,172.16.0.126**

   c. Run the following command to make the configuration take effect:

      **nmcli connection up "**\ *CONNECTION*\ **"**

      In this example, run the following command:

      **nmcli connection up "Wired connection 1"**

      Information similar to the following is displayed:

      |image4|

   d. Run the following command to check whether the virtual IP address has been bound:

      **ip a**

      Information similar to the following is displayed. In the command output, the virtual IP address 172.16.0.125 is bound to NIC eth0.

      |image5|

   **Windows OS** (Windows Server is used as an example here.)

   a. In **Control Panel**, click **Network and Sharing Center**, and click the corresponding local connection.

   b. On the displayed page, click **Properties**.

   c. On the **Network** tab page, select **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)**.

   d. Click **Properties**.

   e. Select **Use the following IP address** and set **IP address** to the private IP address of the ECS, for example, 10.0.0.101.

   f. Click **Advanced**.

   g. On the **IP Settings** tab, click **Add** in the **IP addresses** area.

      Add the virtual IP address. For example, 10.0.0.154.

   h. Click **OK**.

   i. In the **Start** menu, open the Windows command line window and run the following command to check whether the virtual IP address has been configured:

      **ipconfig /all**

      In the command output, **IPv4 Address** is the virtual IP address 10.0.0.154, indicating that the virtual IP address of the ECS NIC has been correctly configured.
