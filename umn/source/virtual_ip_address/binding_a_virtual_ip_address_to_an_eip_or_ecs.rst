Binding a Virtual IP Address to an EIP or ECS
=============================================

Scenarios
---------

You can use a virtual IP address and an EIP together.

If you bind a virtual IP address to ECSs that work in active/standby pairs and bind an EIP to the virtual IP address, you can access the ECSs over the Internet.

Notes and Constraints
---------------------

-  A virtual IP address can only be bound to one EIP.

Binding a Virtual IP Address to an EIP or ECS on the Console
------------------------------------------------------------

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Click |image1| in the upper left corner and select the desired region and project.

#. Click |image2| in the upper left corner and choose **Network** > **Virtual Private Cloud**.

   The **Virtual Private Cloud** page is displayed.

#. In the navigation pane on the left, choose **Virtual Private Cloud** > **Subnets**.

   The **Subnets** page is displayed.

#. Click the name with a hyperlink of the subnet that the virtual IP address belongs to.

   The subnet details page is displayed.

#. Click the **IP Addresses** tab.

   -  To bind a virtual IP address to an EIP, locate the row that contains the virtual IP address and click **Bind to EIP** in the **Operation** column.
   -  To bind a virtual IP address to an ECS, locate the row that contains the virtual IP address and click **Bind to Server** in the **Operation** column.

#. Select the EIP or ECS to be bound.

   .. note::

      -  If an ECS has multiple NICs, bind the virtual IP address to the primary NIC.
      -  An ECS NIC can have multiple virtual IP addresses bound.

#. Click **OK**.

   .. important::

      After a virtual IP address is bound to an ECS NIC, you need to manually configure the virtual IP address on the ECS. For details, see :ref:`Configuring a Virtual IP Address for an ECS <en-us_topic_0067802474__section480517024620>`.

Configuring a Virtual IP Address for an ECS
-------------------------------------------

Manually configure the virtual IP address bound to an ECS.

The following OSs are used as examples here. For other OSs, see the help documents on their official websites.

-  Linux: CentOS 7.2 64bit and Ubuntu 22.04 server 64bit
-  Windows: Windows Server

**Linux (CentOS 7.2 64bit is used as an example.)**

#. .. _en-us_topic_0067802474__li528316578916:

   Obtain the NIC that the virtual IP address is to be bound and the connection of the NIC:

   **nmcli connection**

   Information similar to the following is displayed:

   |image3|

   The command output in this example is described as follows:

   -  **eth0** in the **DEVICE** column indicates the NIC that the virtual IP address is to be bound.
   -  **Wired connection 1** in the **NAME** column indicates the connection of the NIC.

#. .. _en-us_topic_0067802474__li20283257695:

   Add the virtual IP address for the connection:

   **nmcli connection modify "**\ *Connection name of the NIC*\ **"** **+ipv4.addresses** *Virtual IP address*

   Configure the parameters as follows:

   -  *Connection name of the NIC*: The connection name of the NIC obtained in :ref:`1 <en-us_topic_0067802474__li528316578916>`. In this example, the connection name is **Wired connection 1**.
   -  *Virtual IP address*: Enter the virtual IP address to be added. If you add multiple virtual IP addresses at a time, separate every two with a comma (,).

   Example commands:

   -  Adding a single virtual IP address: **nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 1" +ipv4.addresses** **172.16.0.125**
   -  Adding multiple virtual IP addresses: **nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 1" +ipv4.addresses** **172.16.0.125,172.16.0.126**

#. .. _en-us_topic_0067802474__li11209933188:

   Make the configuration in :ref:`2 <en-us_topic_0067802474__li20283257695>` take effect:

   **nmcli connection up "**\ *Connection name of the NIC*\ **"**

   In this example, run the following command:

   **nmcli connection up "Wired connection 1"**

   Information similar to the following is displayed:

   |image4|

#. Check whether the virtual IP address has been bound:

   **ip a**

   Information similar to the following is displayed. In the command output, the virtual IP address 172.16.0.125 is bound to NIC eth0.

   |image5|

   .. note::

      To delete an added virtual IP address, perform the following steps:

      a. Delete the virtual IP address from the connection of the NIC:

         **nmcli connection modify "**\ *Connection name of the NIC*\ **"** **-ipv4.addresses** *Virtual IP address*

         To delete multiple virtual IP addresses at a time, separate every two with a comma (,). Example commands are as follows:

         -  Deleting a single virtual IP address: **nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 1" -ipv4.addresses** **172.16.0.125**
         -  Deleting multiple virtual IP addresses: **nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 1" -ipv4.addresses** **172.16.0.125,172.16.0.126**

      b. Make the deletion take effect by referring to :ref:`3 <en-us_topic_0067802474__li11209933188>`.

**Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 server 64bit is used as an example.)**

For Ubuntu 22 or Ubuntu 20 ECSs, perform the following operations:

#. Obtain the NIC that the virtual IP address is to be bound:

   **ifconfig**

   Information similar to the following is displayed. In this example, the NIC bound to the virtual IP address is **eth0**.

   .. code-block::

   Add a virtual IP address to the NIC.

   a. Open the configuration file **01-netcfg.yaml**:

      **vim 01-netcfg.yaml**

   b. Press **i** to enter the editing mode.

   c. In the NIC configuration area, add a virtual IP address.

      In this example, add a virtual IP address for **eth0**:

      **addresses:**

      b. Make the deletion take effect by referring to :ref:`4 <en-us_topic_0067802474__li1071922334218>`.

**Windows OS** **(Windows Server is used as an example here.)**

#. In **Control Panel**, click **Network and Sharing Center**, and click the corresponding local connection.

#. On the displayed page, click **Properties**.

#. On the **Network** tab page, select **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)**.

#. Click **Properties**.

#. Select **Use the following IP address** and set **IP address** to the private IP address of the ECS, for example, 10.0.0.101.
