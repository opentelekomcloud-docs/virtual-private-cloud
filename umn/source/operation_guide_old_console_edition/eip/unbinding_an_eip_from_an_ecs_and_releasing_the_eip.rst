Unbinding an EIP from an ECS and Releasing the EIP
==================================================

Scenarios
---------

If you no longer need an EIP, unbind it from the ECS and release the EIP to avoid wasting network resources.

Notes and Constraints
---------------------

-  EIP assigned together with your load balancers will also be displayed in the EIP list on the VPC console. On the EIP console or using EIP APIs, you cannot bind EIPs to or unbind them from dedicated load balancers, but you can bind EIPs to or unbind them from shared load balancers.
-  You can only release EIPs that are not bound to any resources.
