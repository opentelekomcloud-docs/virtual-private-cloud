Unbinding an EIP from an ECS and Releasing the EIP
==================================================

Scenarios
---------

If you no longer need an EIP, unbind it from the ECS and release the EIP to avoid wasting network resources.

Notes and Constraints
---------------------

-  In **eu-de**, EIPs of the Dedicated Load Balancer (**5_gray**) type cannot be assigned anymore. You can assign EIPs of the BGP (**5_bgp**) type.
-  Existing EIPs of the Dedicated Load Balancer (**5_gray**) type can be bound to dedicated or shared load balancers.

   -  The EIP console cannot be used to bind EIPs to or unbind them from dedicated load balancers.
   -  You can use APIs to bind EIPs to or unbind them from dedicated load balancers. For details, see `Binding an EIP <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/elastic-ip/api-ref/api_v3/eips/binding_an_eip.html>`__ and `Unbinding an EIP <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/elastic-ip/api-ref/api_v3/eips/unbinding_an_eip.html>`__.
   -  EIPs of this type can be bound to or unbound from shared load balancers using the EIP console or APIs.
   -  You are advised to bind BGP EIPs to or unbind them from dedicated load balancers.

-  EIP assigned together with your load balancers will also be displayed in the EIP list.
-  Only EIPs with no instance bound can be released. If you want to release an EIP with an instance bound, you need to unbind EIP from the instance first.
