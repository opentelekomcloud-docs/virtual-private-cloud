Viewing and Deleting Resources in a Subnet
==========================================

Scenarios
---------

VPC subnets have private IP addresses used by cloud resources. This section describes how to view resources that are using private IP addresses of subnets. If these resources are no longer required, you can delete them.

You can view resources, including ECSs, BMSs, load balancers, and NAT gateways.

.. important::

   After you delete all resources in a subnet by referring to this section, the message "Delete the resource that is using the subnet and then delete the subnet." is displayed when you delete the subnet, you can refer to :ref:`Viewing IP Addresses in a Subnet <vpc_vpc_0012>`.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Click |image1| in the upper left corner and select the desired region and project.

#. Click |image2| in the upper left corner and choose **Network** > **Virtual Private Cloud**.

   The **Virtual Private Cloud** page is displayed.

#. In the navigation pane on the left, choose **Virtual Private Cloud** > **Subnets**.

   The **Subnets** page is displayed.

#. Locate the target subnet and click its name.

   The subnet details page is displayed.

#. On the **Summary** page, view the resources in the subnet.

   a. In the **VPC Resources** area, view the quantities of resources, such as ECSs, BMSs, network interfaces, and load balancers, in the subnet. Click the resource quantity with a hyperlink to view the resources in the subnet.
   b. In the **Networking Components** area on the right of the page, view the NAT gateway, route table, and subnet.
